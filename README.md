Plinko lets players drop a ball from the top of our triangular pin pyramid to find the winning route down to a corresponding multiplier. Inspired by the Japanese mechanical game known as Pachinko, Plinko provides players with the ability to customise your risk factor and multipliers ensuring the game is suited for everyone at our online casino !

I have added one sample video on how exactly the game works in real life
